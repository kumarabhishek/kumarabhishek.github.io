# Design

1. Only chrome is used for dev setup which support natively es6 module. Thus when we do npm start, a server is started in watch mode on client/src. So as soon as the source component is changes, server is reloaded with zero delay. That's it. Is it not simple as no building is involded while develpoment and app is served directly from source folder.
